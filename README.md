# Quiz App of General Knowledge

## How the application operates 

This is an application made in Kotlin that uses knowledge questions to test the users' intellect.
The user will start by inputting their name on the home screen and then clicking the "Next" button to be presented with a question on each page with four possible answers; only one option is the correct one. The user will be presented with a score on the results page letting him/her know how well he/she performed as a fraction of the total number of questions.


## Screens presented

1.Home Screen (HomeFragment)

  * You will be presented with a welcome screen where you will be required to input your name. You will not not be able to click on the "Next" button until you enter a name. If you do not enter a name and try to click "Next", you will receive an error warning stating you should enter your name first.
