# Quiz App of General Knowledge

## How the application operates 

This is an application made in Kotlin that uses knowledge questions to test the users' intellect.
The user will start by inputting their name on the home screen and then clicking the "Next" button to be presented with a question on each page with four possible answers; only one option is the correct one. The user will be presented with a score on the results page letting him/her know how well he/she performed as a fraction of the total number of questions.
